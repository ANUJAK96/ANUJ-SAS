# ANUJ-SAS
A regression model to predict the House Price with variables such as Living area, grade, Living area above base, Basement area. Using SAS, full model with all predictors was modeled.  Residual analysis was performed to validate the model.  Performed extensive exploratory analysis to help with feature engineering, removal of outliers and imputation of missing values.  To explain the variability in better way, interaction terms were added to the full model. Using SAS alternate models were generated and from that, the best model was obtained by model search method.  A final model with the variables was chosen at the end.
